## How to Use

<img width="225" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5062950/121255835-bee49880-c860-11eb-900c-55448c3b48ec.png" alt="ASCT+B-to-CEDAR Exporter"/>

The add-on works only with the [HuBMAP ASCT+B tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F5uoPkO_RudMj7f5qtY3Sh2oBI0NXupvaZXeO59LS-k/edit?usp=sharing). Once it is installed, the add-on is located at "Add-Ons > HuBMAP > ASCT+B-to-CEDAR Exporter" and Google Sheets will display the dialog panel on the right-hand side of the sheet.

The add-on has 4 input fields:
- **Header Row Index** is the row index for the table header.
- **CEDAR API Key** is the API Key that you can get from CEDAR.
- **CEDAR User ID** is your CEDAR user identifier code.
- **CEDAR Folder ID** is the unique folder identifier code on CEDAR.

_(See the sections below to get the CEDAR input parameters from your CEDAR account)_

If you choose the "Do a dry-run" option, the add-on will validate the table by checking if there are any missing data. Running the add-on with this option doesn't require the CEDAR input parameters.

## Working with CEDAR
